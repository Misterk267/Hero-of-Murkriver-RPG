***Hero of Murkriver RPG***

A text-based RPG written in Java.
This project was my first foray into creating an original, complex computer program and was turned in for a grade in my first coding class.
Its puropse is to provide an hour or so of entertainment and has served to sharpen my coding skills. By my current standards the code is quite messy, but
I intend to clean it up in the future.

Version 1 - 10/13/24

Build Instructions:

1. Compile FinalAssignment.java, and the others will follow. As of time of writing the compiler will throw an error caused by slightly inmproper use of array declarations - this can be safely ignored.
2. Run the generated .class file from the command line.
3. Enjoy!
